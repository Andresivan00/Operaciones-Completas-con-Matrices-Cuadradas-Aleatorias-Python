# Complete Operations with Random Square Matrices (Python)

Educational program that generates two square matrices, **A** and **B**, of random size (3×3 to 6×6), and performs **all the classic matrix algebra operations**:

### What this code does

1. **Defines a random size n** between 3 and 6
2. **Fills A and B** with random numbers from 1 to 10
3. Automatically calculates:

   * **C = A + B** → element-wise addition
   * **D = A − B** → element-wise subtraction
   * **E = A × B** → true matrix multiplication (not element-wise!)
4. **Sorts matrix E** from **largest to smallest** using the **bubble sort** algorithm (inefficient but very educational)
